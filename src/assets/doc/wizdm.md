## wizdm.io

Compassionate development[^cd]

[^cd]: Take a look to the [manifesto](../../about)

## Background

A community of compassionate professionals believing that wealth comes from giving and willing to help aspiring entrepreneurs achieving
their business dreams for good

## Revenue streams

>Here to describe how do you plan the generate revenues, if any. It could be by premium or freemium accounts, donations, transaction fees, 
>advertising and more. Be clear and specific.
Wizdm.io is free. We do not charge the applicants since the community is meant to provide highly professional development capabilities to
those start-uppers  who can't afford them yet. Money will come from who the money has such as service providers we do resell the app services
of and, ultimately, from the acceleration funds once the initiative will be  successfully accelerated.

## Context

>Here where to describe how the area you are going to work in looks like. The main topics we recommend clarifying here are:
>
> * Who are the players providing similar products or services
> * What's unique in your offering compared to them
>
>So, basically, how you're going to better solve your future customers' needs.

### Market players

I guess there's nothing like us :P Anyway, I think about Wizdm like something in between the open source movement and the start-up accelerators 
such as Y combinators and 500 startups. 

### Unfair advantages

The core idea of reverting the revenue stream is unique. Wizdm provides startuppers (with no money) the professional capabilities to turn their
ideas into businesses draining resources from the big companies looking for new customers for their freemium/pay as you go services.

## Target market

>Here is where we recommend focusing on:
>
> * The kind of people you want to address
> * The geographical areas you are thinking to start from
>
>An example could be addressing students of all nationality willing to travel to Italy.

### User profile

Dreamers. Aspiring startuppers of any age, nationality, gender and beliefs as long as they share Wizdm core values.

### Geographical coverage

Everywhere - but let's start from planet earth first.

## Conclusions

Can't wait to see it turning real...
