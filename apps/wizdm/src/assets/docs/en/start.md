Wizdm is an evolving boilerplate designed to help developers getting started with their single page application. It is based upon the [Angular framework](https://angular.io) and utilizes several well known packages and technologies:

* [Material Design](https://material.io) as the design and styling system backed by [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) package. This includes the [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.io/cdk) to implement common interaction patterns.
* [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is the main layout system to ensure a smooth and responsive navigation thank to the help of [Angular Layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki) package.
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as the primary backend leveraging [Angular Fire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire) package. Wizdm was born as a serverless application, so, it is likely to stay that way althougt contributions to expand its backend capabilities are more than welcome.
